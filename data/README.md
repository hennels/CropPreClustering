# Datasets
Two synthetic point clouds and four real-world point clouds are provided for evaluation.

## Synthetic Data
Using the single plant reconstructions from [Corn50](https://github.com/hennels/Corn50) `data/0to9_1M` and `data/10to29_1M` were created by aggregating them into a single point cloud. The ground truth information is encoded as the RGB color. Each plant is mapped to a unique RGB triple.

The files with longer names in those folders are the point clouds which were evaluated for results in the tables in the paper.

## Real-World Data
Each point cloud is produced via structure from motion via Pix4D.
